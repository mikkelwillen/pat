General comments:
Please take a look at all of the tasks for the resubmission.

Task 1:
Very fine explanation, but you really need to *show* the process.
I.e: Show all the elements in the seen sets, what they look like when specialized, etc.

Task 2:
Which Futamura projection is this? (The 1., 2., or 3.)
Think of what input is being given at specialization time.

Task 3:
This residual program does not seem to match up with the input program.
For example, in lab0, you immediatly go to lab7 which is the final state.

Task 4:
The number of static values at specialization time is finite because the static values are just fragments of the static TM-program.
Thus, there is only a finite number of different PE states and the partial evaluator terminates.
