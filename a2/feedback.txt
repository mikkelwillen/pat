# Feedback

General comments:
I urge you to take a look at the feedback for each task and resubmit next monday.

Task 1:
The description is missing an important part of the code (which also affects the final value of i and j).
(The final text store is also missing)

Task 2:
Code is almost ok but it does not handle the code array correctly, meaning they are not functionally equivalent.
Surely there are more differences between the two programs? (The extra loop in the Janus version)
For the programs to be functionally equivalent they must have the same effect.

Task 3:
This is not correct, the program itself is not a valid Janus program.
Please look at it more carefully for next time. For the loops, consider looking at the flowchart version
as well.

Task 4:
While the descriptions are decently concise, they are also a imprecise.
Especially the loops are lacking details.
Consider writing it in a more formal way, f.x. Inv(x += e) = x -= e, etc.

Task 5:
Your discussion of difficulties is not relevant as you are meant to discuss the inversion process.
The function is also not a true inversion of the encode function (but encode was also slightly wrong anyways).

Task 6:
The final output is correct but note that you should trace *each* statement, not just the outer loop.

Task 7:
The answer is correct, but is there perhaps a smarter way of getting that answer?
Note that the task requires you to show *how* you ran the program as well.
