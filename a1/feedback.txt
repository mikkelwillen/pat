General comments:
A few issues (see comments), but overall a solid effort.

Task 1:
There is a bit of an issue with variable names.
A program inverter should explicitly take a program as input.
Note the inverse interpreter is normally referred to as "invint".

Task 2:
Ignoring the issues with variable names, this is a valid solution to the *first* task.

Task 3 and 4:
This is the wrong program (Fig. 8, not 12).
Another important note is that you should also check the post-condition of if-fi statements!
Otherwise looks good.

Task 5:
Good description of the reversible updates (+=, -=) and the swap statement.
Please look at the description of the loops again (specifically with e1).
You are also forgetting the hidden sequence statement (s1 s2)!

Task 6:
The shape of the updates are generally of the form (x += e), not (x += y). (Expression, not var)
Transforming the program for the loop case is also a bit cheeky (and wrong semantics, see task 5).
The syntax for the reverse semantics of updates is swapped but the names are good
(they are just the same as forward currently).
Sequence statement still missing.
